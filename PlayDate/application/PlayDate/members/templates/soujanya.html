        <p>I am Soujanya Nayak. I live in Fremont with my husband. I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and currently
            pursuing Masters in Computer Science. I have around 5 years experience as data engineer. But I want to see
            myself grow as a Software Engineer. I am happy to work with this amazing team. I am learning a lot from all
            of
            them.</p>
        <p>My new found passion in California is travelling and hiking. The above picture was taken at Lake Tahoe. My
            most
            favourite hike till date was Mist Trail in Yosemite.</p>
